# GDPS-Patcher
Patchs your gdps
## Usage

First download or compile the source then use cmd to run it with 2 params, first the location of the gdps exe and the second one being the url of the server, DO NOT INCLUDE A / AT THE END OF THE URL and it should be patched

if you are doing it for android then you can use the libcocos2dcpp.so file on the patcher instead of a exe

I havent tested this on ios gd but it may work
